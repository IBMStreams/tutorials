To continue with this part even if you did not successfully complete the previous part, import a Streams project that has been prepared for you, containing the expected results of Part 3.

1. In the Project Explorer, right-click on the current project and choose Close Project. This gets it out of the way for builds or name conflicts, without deleting any files.

1. In the top Eclipse menu, choose File > Import….

1. In the Import dialog, select InfoSphere Streams Studio > SPL Project; click Next >.

1. Click Browse…; in the file browser, expand My Home and select Labs. Click OK.

  This kicks off a build, but there is no need to wait until it finishes.
