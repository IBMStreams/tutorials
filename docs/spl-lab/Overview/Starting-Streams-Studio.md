# Starting Streams Studio
---

To start Streams Studio:

1. On the VMware desktop, double-click the Streams Studio shortcut.

1. Accept the prepopulated workspace (/homes/streamsadmin/workspace) and click **OK**.

### Components of the Streams Studio interface

The Eclipse integrated development (IDE) environment is divided into multiple windows, which are called views.

* **Project Explorer** - Shows project contents and details.
* **Streams Explorer** - Shows domain and instance information, including any jobs that are running.
* **Editing pane** - Empty when Studio is started. This is where you edit code or create application graphs.
* **Outline** - When an SPL source file is open in the editor, this shows ...
* **Console** - Shows progress messages.
* **Properties** - Shows operator propery values. You can change these values here.
* **Problems** - Logs problems or errors such as syntax errors, grouped by severity. This will not be used in this lab.

Taken together, all of these views comprise a **perspective** in Eclipse. When you open Streams Studio, it opens to the Streams perspective as seen below.

<h4>InfoSphere?</h4> You might see a few places where Streams is referred to as InfoSphere Streams. The name was shortened in the 4.1 release, but a few places (such as installation directories) still use InfoSphere Streams.
