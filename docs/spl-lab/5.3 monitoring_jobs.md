# Monitoring jobs

1. 	Maximize the **Streams Graph** card. You can also enlarge it, using the resize handle   at the bottom right of the card, just enough to show the entire graph. Move it to another position and remove other cards as you see fit.

  The graph is familiar from the **Instance Graph** in Studio, though it represents information in slightly different ways. It labels every stream with the tuple rate, and indicates operator health by a colored dot. As in the **Instance Graph**, relative tuple rate sets the thickness of the arrow. Usually the **Throttled** stream, at 40 tuples per second (give or take a few), is the thickest, but every so often the **Observations** stream, normally at zero, exceeds it. You observed the same behavior in the **Flow Rate Chart**.

  The **Streams Graph** is an alternative to the **Summary** card to detect trouble (unhealthy PEs), and to identify bottlenecks that may affect throughput performance. A bottleneck is an operator that limits the flow of tuples, usually because it cannot process any more tuples per second with the CPU cycles it has. If you did the optional section on indentifying problems as they occur, you saw that the Throttle operator was the cause of congestion that builds up over time.

  > **An artificial bottleneck.** In most “real” applications, there is no place for a Throttle operator; you only used it here to simulate a data source with a manageable flow rate. Here, it also serves as a useful illustration of the concept of back pressure, and of the tools for identifying real bottlenecks.

  Even if congestion has not yet built up, a good indicator of a candidate for a bottleneck is a PE that consumes lots of CPU cycles: it would be toward the top in the **PE Metrics Scatter Chart**.

2. 	Hover over the topmost point(s) in the PE Metrics Scatter Chart (highest in CPU consumption).
Chances are, the operator is called **Throttled**. Apparently, the Throttle operator consumes CPU cycles to slow down the flow, while all the others are reading and writing files, or filtering and aggregating tuples, at very low CPU cost.
Of course, as long as the PE keeps up with the tuple flow, high CPU load doesn’t necessarily mean bottleneck. In this case, it is not apparent until the job has run for a long time that the Throttle operator is indeed a bottleneck.
